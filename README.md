# 100-href

We will make a website with 100+ pages

## We are aiming to create 100+ clickable links

Just add a new title in index.html in the navbar and in href give the link of your file which supposed to be in assets folder.

`Button Template`

```
<button class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="./assets/{your name}/index.html">{Your Name}</a>
</button>
```

- copy this code and past at inside the container div tag.

Structure could be assets/userName
eg:- assets/Crysosancher

## Come on let me see your creativity.
